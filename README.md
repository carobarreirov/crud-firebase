# JS [CRUD] App with Firebase

Javascript To-Do List CRUD Application with Firebase-Firestore version 9.0.

With this project we will apply our three web development layers: html, css and js to our first simple application: A To-Do List.
Our application will have the four basic CRUD operations: create, read, update and delete.
All our tasks will be stored in a database and all operations will be reflected in that database. For that last point we will use a Firebase service: Firestore.

## Usage 

You can go to the To-Do List App on live through [crud-firebase repository](https://carobarreirov.github.io/crud-firebase/) to see how it works. 

You'll find and intro and more information about the tools we use. 
In the [App section](https://carobarreirov.github.io/crud-firebase/#app) you will be able to interact with the four CRUD operations through the shown interface.

 Everything you see is being updated on the console in our Firebase project under the Cloud Firestore database.
