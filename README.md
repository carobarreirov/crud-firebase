# JS [CRUD] App with Firebase :fire:

[Javascript To-Do List CRUD Application](https://carobarreirov.github.io/crud-firebase/#app) with Firebase-Firestore version 9.0.

With this project we will apply our three web development layers: html, css and js to our first simple application: A To-Do List :ballot_box_with_check:.

Our application will have the four basic CRUD operations: create, read, update and delete.

All our tasks will be stored in a database and all operations will be reflected in that database. For that last point we will use a Firebase service: Firestore.
